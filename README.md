# (Scientific Paper) Machine Learning Adaptive Control Motor Inertia - Python and Matlab 

This repository stores all the codes used for the scientific paper entitled **"Adaptive Pole Positioning Control using Machine Learning for DC Motor with Variable Inertia"**. It consists of python and matlab codes that were used to simulate 2000 different DC motors, obtain the necessary data and train 4 supervised machine learning models for regression, with the objective of creating a control element that regulates the speed of the motor when inertia changes.

## Folders description üìÅ

* **[Etapa1-Modelo_Referencia]**: This folder contains the Matlab code that simulates a DC motor as a reference model to which the motor should be adapted when the inertia varies. The folder stores the matlab code and the simulink file with the mathematical model of the motor.

* **[Etapa2-Obtencion_Dataset]**: This folder contains the Matlab code that obtains data from 2000 mathematical models of DC motors built in simulink that differ by a small variation in inertia. 

* **[Etapa3-Entrenamiento_Validacion]**: This folder contains the Python code documented through Google Colab notebooks where 4 machine learning models are trained and validated. Specifically the algorithms are: polynomial regression, decision tree, random forest and support vector machine.

* **[Etapa4-Comparacion_Resultados]**: This folder contains the Python code documented through Google Colab notebooks where the validation behavior of the 4 machine learning models is graphically compared.

* **[Etapa5-Implementacion]**: This folder contains an application made in Matlab AppDesigner that shows the behavior of the machine learning models under the current inertia of the DC motor.
