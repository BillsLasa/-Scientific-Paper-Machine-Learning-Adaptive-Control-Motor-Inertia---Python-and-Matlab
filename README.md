# (Scientific Paper) Machine Learning Adaptive Control Motor Inertia - Python and Matlab 

This repository stores all the codes used for the scientific paper entitled **"Adaptive Pole Positioning Control using Machine Learning for DC Motor with Variable Inertia"**. It consists of python and matlab codes that were used to simulate 2000 different DC motors, obtain the necessary data and train 4 supervised machine learning models for regression, with the objective of creating a control element that regulates the speed of the motor when inertia changes.

## Folders description üìÅ

* **[MICROCONTROLADOR]**: This folder contains the code in C language and the necessary libraries for the logic and communication of the joystick implemented with a PIC C microcontroller.

* **[VIDEOJUEGO]**: This folder contains the code in python language, the images and audios necessary for the logic and communication of the spaceship videogame.


## Main Files description üìò

* **[mando.c]**: This file contains the C language code of the PIC16877A microcontroller. It contains the logic and the communication parameters to connect to the spaceship videogame. It is necessary to clarify that it is thought for a Joystick connected by USB to a computer.

* **[mando.hex]**: This file contains the C language code of "mando.c" translated to "machine" language for uploading directly to the microcontroller.

* **[lcd.c]**: This file is the library used to control and manage an LCD display that is part of the Joystick.

* **[videogame.py]**: This file contains the code in Python language that conforms the spaceship videogame as well as the communication parameters with the PIC microcontroller connected to the USB of the computer where it is running.
